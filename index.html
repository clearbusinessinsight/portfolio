        <p>
          As the founder and owner of CAC By Design (Kitchen and Bath Remodeling), CLEAR Business Insight & Local 
          Trusted Expert I found that there is no real standout software specifically designed to operate a small 
          business. Software designed for the Kitchen / Bath and Countertop industry has many specific challenges 
          that when solved translate very well to almost every other small business in every industry. I have spent 
          the last 5 years working with programmers from around the world only to find that their lack of small business 
          knowledge and structure prevents them from coding software to meet the needs of a small business. Prior to 
          starting CAC By Design I programmed in Basic, Visual Basic and several other hybrid launguages. After starting 
          to work with coding teams I quickly learn that they either lack the knowledge to execute the level of 
          complexity CLEAR Business Insight needs or they lack the desire to stay focussed to get it done. 
          I have learned that there are dozens of ways to get a task done but each path a code writer takes has both 
          advantages and disadvantages to future code that will need to be written. By learning code myself I will be 
          able to keep the future in focus while creating the code for the present and to direct the team to do the same.
