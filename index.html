    <img src="./assets/images/Janet & I.jpg" alt="Janet and I">
    <p>As the founder and owner of CAC By Design (Kitchen and Bath Remodeling), CLEAR Business Insight & Local Trusted Expert I found that there is no real standout software specifically designed to operate a small business. Software designed for the Kitchen / Bath and Countertop industry has many specific challenges that when solved translate very well to almost every other small business in every industry. I have spent the last 5 years working with programmers from around the world only to find that their lack of small business knowledge and structure prevents them from coding software to meet the needs of a small business. Prior to starting CAC By Design I programmed in Basic, Visual Basic and several other hybrid launguages. After starting to work with coding teams I quickly learn that they either lack the knowledge to execute the level of complexity CLEAR Business Insight needs or they lack the desire to stay focussed to get it done. I have learned that there are dozens of ways to get a task done but each path a code writer takes has both advantages and disadvantages to future code that will need to be written. By learning code myself I will be able to keep the future in focus while creating the code for the present and to direct the team to do the same. </p>
