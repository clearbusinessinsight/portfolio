## 02 Advanced CSS:  Portfolio

This is a repo for my portfolio

This is the readme file for the HomeWork Assignment Week 2. This portfolio will act as the place for me to save all future work.

Creating code that follows accesibility standards and is optimized for search engines

The assignment was to create a 1 page potfolio from scratch.

- 2 This will showcase my future work as well as the thought process behind creating it.
- 3 The portfolio should showcase flexbox, media queries, and css variables.
